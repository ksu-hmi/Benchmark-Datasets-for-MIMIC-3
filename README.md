# Demonstrating How MIMIC-III Benchmarks Run in Python
The goal for the HMI 7540 class project is to feature a GitHub repository using Python code with the MIMIC-III database, which is a database some Cohort 2 students will access in the Fall semester. The outcome of the project is to upload onto our class' GitHub account an original, voice-over Powerpoint presentation explaining the Python/MIMIC-111 repository and showing how the code works.  the workings of the code.

Cornell University researchers Hrayr Harutyunyan, Hrant Khachatrian, David C. Kale, Greg Ver Steeg, and Aram Galstyan used Python code to build machine learning datasets from the MIMIC-III database. An article derived from their research is published here: (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07771). Their repositiory met the goals for the HMI 7540 class project and can be found here: (https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks). 

# MIMIC-III
MIMIC-III is one of the largest and most publically accessible critical care unit (i.e., intensive care unit) databases in the world. (https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635) Access to it is granted after passing a series of courses located online at the CITI Program website. The Citi Program is designed to educate faculty and students about issues involving human subject research.(https://about.citiprogram.org/en/homepage/) 

MIMIC-III is a relational database composed of 26 tables housing the deidentified clinical information of ~40,000 patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. It is maintained by the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology and other research groups and MIT wrote the CITI Program training courses.
