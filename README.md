# Demonstrating How MIMIC-III Benchmarks Run in Python
For our class project, using guidelines provided by Professor Thomas, I will evaluate the work begun by four researchers from Cornell University who are using Python and MIMIC-III data I their efforts to develop “four clinical prediction benchmarks.” (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07771)  
OrOn May 30, Professor Thomas and I modified the project to developing and presenting a voice-over instruction video illustrating how to  run the benchmarks  code written in Python for the MIMIC-III database. developed , making that into a .ppt presentation with voiceover so we could upload it to the class github account. Assuming I heard that correctly, I've begun following the Steps 1-6 on how to run the benchmarks. Those steps are found midway down on this page here:  https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks. I opened up a GIT CMD and started the first step.

**Why This Project**
MIMIC III is a rich database that I've worked in for about 8 months. (In order to work with this database, a researcher must complete a series of Stage 1 Data or Specimens Only "courses from the Massachuettes Institute of Technology found through the Citiprogram. The link to that program is here:

This fall, my GRA professor and I will be doing work in MIMIC III using machine learning and other technologies similar to those used in the **benchmarks** project I am studying for this class assignment. That's the reason I choose this project to work on.
