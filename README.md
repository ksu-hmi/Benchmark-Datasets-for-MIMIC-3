# Evaluation-of-Python-suite-to-construct-benchmark-machine-learning-datasets-from-MIMIC-III
For our class project, using guidelines provided by Professor Thomas, I will evaluate the work begun by four researchers from Cornell University who are using Python and MIMIC-III data I their efforts to develop “four clinical prediction benchmarks.” (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07771)  

*Here is a link to the original researchers' github repository:*

**Why This Project**
MIMIC III is a rich database that I've worked in for about 8 months. (In order to work with this database, a researcher must complete a series of Stage 1 Data or Specimens Only "courses from the Massachuettes Institute of Technology found through the Citiprogram. The link to that program is here:
https://about.citiprogram.org/en/homepage/. 

This fall, my GRA professor and I will be doing work in MIMIC III using machine learning and other technologies similar to those used in the **benchmarks** project I am studying for this class assignment. That's the reason I choose this project to work on.
