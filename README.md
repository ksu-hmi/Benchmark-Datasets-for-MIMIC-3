# Demonstrating How MIMIC-III Benchmarks Run in Python
The goal for the HMI 7540 class project was to work with a GitHub repository that featured Python and the MIMIC-III database, which is a database some Cohort 2 students will access in the Fall semester. MIMIC-III is one of the largest publically accessible critical care (i.e., intensive care) databases in the world. Access to it is granted after passing a series of courses developed by MIT and maintained by The CITI program, which is an online training platform for courses designed to educate faculty and students about issues involving human subject research.

MIMIC-III is the latest upgrade (from MIMIC-II) of a relational database composed of 26 tables housing deidentified clinical information of ~40,000 patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. It is maintained by the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology and other research groups. More information on MIMICis maintained by is mahttps://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635Cornell University researchers Hrayr Harutyunyan, Hrant Khachatrian, David C. Kale, Greg Ver Steeg, and Aram Galstyan used Python code to build machine learning datasets from the MIMIC-III database. An article derived from their research is published here: (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07771)

Below are some code links and a brief description, 

The outcome of the project is to upload onto our class' GitHub account an original voice-over Powerpoint illustrating the 6 steps on how to run the benchmarks.  code written in Python for the MIMIC-III database. developed , making that into a .ppt presentation with voiceover so we could upload it to the class github account. Assuming I heard that correctly, I've begun following the Steps 1-6 on how to run the benchmarks. Those steps are found midway down on this page here:  https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks. I opened up a GIT CMD and started the first step. 


*And, here is a link to their paper about these benchmarks:*


**Why This Project**
MIMIC III is a rich database that I've worked in for about 8 months. (In order to work with this database, a researcher must complete a series of Stage 1 Data or Specimens Only "courses from the Massachuettes Institute of Technology found through the Citiprogram. The link to that program is here:
https://about.citiprogram.org/en/homepage/. 

This fall, my GRA professor and I will be doing work in MIMIC III using machine learning and other technologies similar to those used in the **benchmarks** project I am studying for this class assignment. That's the reason I choose this project to work on.
