# Demonstrating How MIMIC-III Benchmarks Run in Python
The goal for the HMI 7540 class project was to find and present information on a GitHub repository that featured Python and the MIMIC-III database because the MIMIC-III database could be an asset for other students in Cohort 2. That goal was realized in the open source work produced by four researchers from Cornell University who used Python to build â€œfour clinical prediction benchmark machine learning datasets from the MIMIC-III clinical database." The link to their article publication is here: (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07771)  And, the link to their github repository is https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks.

The outcome of the project is to upload onto our class' GitHub account an original voice-over Powerpoint illustrating how to run the benchmarks code written in Python for the MIMIC-III database. developed , making that into a .ppt presentation with voiceover so we could upload it to the class github account. Assuming I heard that correctly, I've begun following the Steps 1-6 on how to run the benchmarks. Those steps are found midway down on this page here:  https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks. I opened up a GIT CMD and started the first step. 


*And, here is a link to their paper about these benchmarks:*

**Why This Project**
MIMIC III is a rich database that I've worked in for about 8 months. (In order to work with this database, a researcher must complete a series of Stage 1 Data or Specimens Only "courses from the Massachuettes Institute of Technology found through the Citiprogram. The link to that program is here:
https://about.citiprogram.org/en/homepage/. 

This fall, my GRA professor and I will be doing work in MIMIC III using machine learning and other technologies similar to those used in the **benchmarks** project I am studying for this class assignment. That's the reason I choose this project to work on.
