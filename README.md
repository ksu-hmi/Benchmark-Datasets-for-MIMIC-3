# Evaluation-of-Python-suite-to-construct-benchmark-machine-learning-datasets-from-MIMIC-III
For our class project, using guidelines provided by Professor Thomas, I will evaluate the work begun by four researchers from Cornell University who are using Python and MIMIC-III data I their efforts to develop “four clinical prediction benchmarks.” (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07771)
